# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project explores movie recommendation using **four different programming paradigms**:

- **Java** â€“ Object-Oriented approach  
- **Go** â€“ Concurrent and efficient backend logic  
- **Prolog** â€“ Logic-based reasoning for recommendation rules  
- **Scheme** â€“ Functional paradigm for list processing and transformations

We use the **Movie Lens Small Latest Dataset(ml-latest-small) dataset** to analyze user preferences and recommend movies based on ratings, and viewing history.

### ðŸ§  Goals
- Compare the implementation of a common algorithm across different paradigms
- Demonstrate the strengths and trade-offs of each language
- Provide an educational resource for students and developers exploring multi-paradigm software development

### ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each language has its own directory with a README and implementation of the recommendation engine.
